# Booking Reviews Validation â€” LLM Topic & Sentiment Validation

This project verifies the quality of LLM-generated sentiment and topic classifications on hotel booking reviews.  
The pipeline compares original cleaned user texts with model-produced labels and evaluates:

- âœ… Sentiment correctness (Positive / Negative / Neutral)
- âœ… Topic volume distribution accuracy
- âœ… False matches, missed matches, & alignment quality
- âœ… Real vs model-generated category proportions

Although the validation logic can run headlessly, **Jupyter Notebook** is included for clarity and visual demonstration (charts, confusion matrix, summary metrics).  
It was used as a transparent way to explore results step-by-step during analysis.
